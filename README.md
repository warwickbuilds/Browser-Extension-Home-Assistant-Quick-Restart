# Home Assistant Quick Rest Browser Extension
Simple page action browser extension that allows you to quickly restart Home Assitant if an instance is detect on the active page.

If button is active a Home Assistant instance has been detected and when click a configuration check will first be performed and if successful a restart will be called.

- Only tested with HASSio via direct access or Nuba Casa remote link (Let me know if it works/doesn't work with other access method and Home Assistant)
